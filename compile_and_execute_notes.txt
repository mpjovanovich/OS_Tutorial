We can compile usign the nasm program as follows:

nasm input_file.asm -f bin -o output_file.bin

We can include assemblies that we've already written with an "include" directive as such.
This will replace the include line with the code from the other file:

%include "some_function.asm"


The program we're using to run this is qemu. Just call the bin as follows:

qemu output_file.bin
